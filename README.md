# TwoLayerPerceptron

This project was written in Python3 using the matplotlib and numpy libraries.

It impliments a neural network from scratch based on class notes and specification.

It's using the MNIST data set of hand written digits for training and testing.

perceptron.py is a single layer perceptron using the MNSIT data set.

twolayernn.py is a two layer neural network.

Both require matplotlib and numpy libraries.
